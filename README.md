Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 *Mastering complexity
 *Mastering machine
 *Mastering process

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
*Planning- Identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
*Requirements Gathering and Analysis- Understan what the software must achieve
*System Design- Plan how to build system
*Coding(Implementation)- Translate design into functional code
*Testing- Ensure the software works as intended and is bug free
*Deployment- Release the softwareto users
*Maintenance And Support- Keep the software functional and up to date

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
- there is Low flexibility,
 changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
 - Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
 - Testing is done at the end of the development process.


agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

- Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it 
  ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
- Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
- help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
- System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
- It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
- Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating 
  user behaviors. 
- Whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


  -Prompt Engineering is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
    Importance:
  -Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human      bias in the large language models’ training data.
  -Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
  -Developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large 
      Language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

  Draw a picture of a person
  Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background.
-Clarity: The improved prompt specifies what is being asked (a full-body portrait) rather than just a "person.
-Specific Details: Describing the woman's appearance (long brown hair, red jacket, blue jeans) and the setting (park, sunny day, trees, grass) gives clear guidance on the image to be     created.
-Concise: The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.
